## Description

CustomFit is a web application created to fetch data from Third Party APIs to customize a work out plan for the user and retrieve their BMI based on the specific measurements entered and saved by local storage.  

## Purpose 

This web application was built based on a passion for fitness and health. Many people do not feel comfortable starting off with a personal trainer at a gym or they are at a loss as to what they should be doing based off their needs. CustomFit helps users find a work out plan and it informs them as to where their body mass fits in accordance with their measurements. 

## Education

The project allowed us to learn how to retrieve information from Third Party APIs in order to utilize and combine the information received to deliver a product to users. It also taught us how to collaborate with one another in the group online and create a useful web application.
